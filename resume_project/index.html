                        <p class="article-excerpt text-dark fs-5">Three days before early voting closed in Maryland, my editor asked me to get a quick-hit data piece out on early voter turnout. For this article, I analyzed early voter results and turnout data at the county level to see how things had changed since 2016. I led the data analysis and created data visualizations, working alongside another data reporter to ensure a thorough analysis with a quick turnaround. I also used Vote Smart, a resource for journalists covering elections, to connect with political experts on a tight deadline. We conducted all analysis and reporting in three days, publishing the morning after early voting closed.</p>

                        <p class="article-excerpt text-dark fs-5">I saw a lot of enthusiasm for the Harris campaign in the weeks after she announced her bid for president, especially from young voters. I wanted to see how that bore out in voter registration data. This piece was difficult because of the sheer volume of data – I had never worked with a dataset this large before and there were many stories I could tell with it. I analyzed millions of rows of voter registration data in R, looking at how voter registration had changed over time and comparing different demographics including age, gender, party affiliation and home county. I conducted all the interviews for this article and created the graphics using Flourish.

                        <p class="article-excerpt text-dark fs-5">While reporting on out-of-state abortion patients in Maryland, we found that many patients were being pushed later into pregnancy as they struggled to get an abortion within their state’s legal time limit. Abortion access advocates were sending more patients to Maryland, often the nearest state allowing abortions in the second and third trimester. I was the lead reporter and writer on this article. My colleague helped with reporting and created an audio version of the article.</p>

                        <p class="article-excerpt text-dark fs-5">I wrote this article in my first semester of grad school as part of a class covering journalists imprisoned overseas with investigative journalist Dana Priest of the Washington Post. I am particularly interested in press freedom in Latin America, and welcomed the opportunity to use my intermediate Spanish language skills. For this article I did deep research on the political landscape in Guatemala and spoke with exiled journalists who had fled the country due to government persecution. This required intentional communication using secure platforms to ensure my sources remained confidential in some cases. I conducted interviews in Spanish and English with the help of a translator for sources who only spoke Spanish. I wanted to ensure we published in both languages and enlisted a translator to help draft a Spanish language version.</p>

                        <p class="article-excerpt text-dark fs-5">For this piece, I worked with a local business owner who had recently opened her first coffee shop. Six years ago, she was a homeless mother in Washington, D.C. raising her young daughter and struggling to get stable housing. I spent a day at the coffee shop talking with her and her daughter as she worked her shift. I loved writing this article because I am passionate about solutions journalism and sharing empowering stories, especially for communities where negative news tends to dominate the headlines.</p>

                        <p class="article-excerpt text-dark fs-5">I created this tool to help reporters cover housing and evictions in Washington, D.C. The Office of the Tenant Advocate posts PDFs of scheduled evictions each month, which are difficult to analyze and access in aggregate. To address this, I built a web scraper to automatically check for new PDFs weekly, clean the data, add it to a running database and send me an alert.</p>
                        <p class="article-excerpt text-dark fs-5">Then I developed a Flask-based application that allows reporters to look at evictions by ward, filter for specific dates or timeframes, search by address and compare eviction rates by ward alongside Census data on race, median income, and other demographics. The tool also displays a heat map to identify eviction hotspots in the city.</p>
                        <p class="article-excerpt text-dark fs-5">I had never written Python code before starting this project, which also served as a crash course in web scraping and building web applications. I'm currently expanding this into a public-facing tool so readers can explore the geography of eviction in the city. I’m also using property records data and landlord violations to understand how demographics such as race and income and corporate ownership of homes in D.C. impacts eviction and landlord violation rates.</p>
